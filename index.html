                            <p align="justify">uORocketry, the University of Ottawa Rocketry Team, develops rockets!  Since its inception, the team has developed and tested a hybrid rocket engine, a novel parachute concept, custom avionics systems, unique ignition mechanisms, different control schemas for both engine thrust throttling and air-braking, a payload designed to observe the effects of high acceleration on the hemolysis of blood cells, and a custom simulation suite for the purposes of performance optimization. While this list is not exhaustive, it exemplifies the ideologies of this team: to pursue interesting projects. </p>

                            <p align="justify">We have competed at the Spaceport America Cup, an international student rocketry competition, in 2018 and 2019.  Once again this year, we were one of the few teams invited to give a technical presentation; we discussed our ongoing search for a clever air-braking scheme that allows for a precise final altitude during flights. This past year, the team successfully launched and recovered our competition rocket, Jackalope.  The team achieved fourth place out of 47 teams in the 10000ft altitude, commercial motor category for an overall ranking of eighth place out of 122 teams competing!  This puts uORocketry in the top 10 on an international stage. </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The team looks to push past simply competing at the Spaceport America Cup by building on the technologies that will help get the team into the student rocketry space race - which involves launching a rocket that reaches a final altitude of greater than 100km. Beyond rockets, we’re also competing in the CAN-RGX (Canada Reduced Gravity Experiment) where we’ve collaborated with the Brown Lab at McMaster University to investigate the effect of microgravity on the antibiotic resistance of Salmonella. Furthermore, the team looks to continue fostering relations with our international industry and academic partners (such as the Department of Medicine at uOttawa, CAE Inc and SBG Systems), so that our development could complement theirs.
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                To summarize, uORocketry is a multidisciplinary student engineering team that builds rockets and incidentally advances several technologies through the meticulous combination of engineering practice and a rocket scientist’s audacity.

                            <p>Ask any team member and they will explain that we have the <b>hottest</b> competition of any uOttawa Team!  We compete against teams from around the world at <a href="https://www.spaceportamericacup.com/">Spaceport America Cup</a> in the middle of the New Mexico desert.</p>
                            <p>
                                During competition week, teams launch student designed and developed rockets to carry an 8.8lb scientific payload to 10,000 ft. Our competitive advantage is an automated air braking system which is fully controlled
                                by our onboard flight computer to increase our drag and slow us down as we approach altitude. In addition to the flight component, we participate in a poster session to showcase the technical challenges we overcame.
                            </p>
                            <p>
								In 2019, uORocketry competed in the 10,000ft target apogee (point in the orbit of an object orbiting Earth) in the commercial off the shelf (COTS) motor category.  Before successfully launching and recovering our rocket, we
								were one out of 24 teams selected to give a technical presentation on our unique model for predictive control of our rocket's custom airbrake.  This past competition we placed 4th in our category and earned 8th place overall!

                                        The beginnings of rocketry are synonymous with the beginnings of rocket engines: devices that abuse Newton’s third to move things around. The propulsion subteam works to build the next generation of uORocketry’s hybrid rocket engines - which will be used to compete at SA CUP and beyond.

Our past projects include hemolyzing blood to assist with the Marrow project, attempting to create a rocket-launched drone as well as participating in the Canada Reduced Gravity Experiment (CAN-RGX) to investigate the effect of microgravity on the antibiotic resistance of E. Coli. Basically, if you can think of something really cool to put on the rocket, we will.
